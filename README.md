# desktop-distros-config
My personal configuration for some GNU/Linux desktop distros. Please don't use
it as it is, since it's designed for my personal case.

Debian is my main distro at the moment, so other distro files may be outdated.

After running every command, I should configure:

- GNOME
- GNOME Tweaks
- GNOME Disks (auto-mount secondary hard drive)
- GNOME Text Editor
- GNOME Terminal
- Nautilus
- Firefox (in `about:config`, put `extensions.pocket.enabled` and
  `middlemouse.paste` to `false`)
- Telegram Desktop
- Skype
- VS Code
- Transmission
- Rhythmbox
- KeePassXC
- OBS Studio
- Anki

GNOME extensions:

- https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4630/no-titlebar-when-maximized/
- https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/946/panel-world-clock-lite/

And finally:

```sh
git config --global user.name "<USER>"
git config --global user.email "<USER>"
```
